</center>
<h3>
<p style="font-family:cursive">Environment includes the living and nonliving things that an organism interacts with, 
or has an effect on it. Living elements that an organism interacts with are known as biotic elements:
animals, plants, etc., abiotic elements are non living things which include air, water, sunlight etc.
Things in the natural environment that we value are called natural resources. For example; fish, insects, and forests.
These are renewable resources because they come back naturally when we use them. 
Non-renewable resources are important things in the environment that are limited for example, 
ores and fossil fuels after a few thousand years. Some things in the natural environment can kill people, such as lightning.</p></h3>

<p style="font-family:cursive">Studying the environment means studying the relationships among these various things.
 An example of interactions between non-living and living things is plants getting their 
 minerals from the soil and making food using sunlight.Predation, an organism eating another,
 is an example of interaction between living things.</p>
